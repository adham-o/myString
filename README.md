# myString
My own **simple** implementation of the string.h header file from the C Standard Library. It is nothing fancy, only non-system functions are implement up to the *ISO/IEC 9899:1999* (AKA *C99*) standard. The library provides a greatly simplified implementation of these functions for educational purposes (well, **MY** educational purposes, at least).  

Functions that are defined in string.h but are excluded from myString.h are:

- *strcoll*
- *strerror*
- *strxfrm*
